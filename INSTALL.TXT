The project should be placed in the location of your choice on your web server.

Log in to your MySQL server as an administrator or root.

Create a new database on your MySQL if desired, you may choose to use an existing database if you prefer
but this leaves the possibility of naming conflicts.

You may create a MySQL user with limited access rights if desired. When running the application requires
rights to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and EXECUTE. In future the rights for CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES and LOCK TABLES may be used but these are not currently required.

In your selected database run the Create.sql file. This file does not need to be present on your web server.

After the Create.sql file has run run the Populate.sql file. This file also does not need to be present on 
your web server.

Update the resources/get_settings.php file with the relevant details for your MySQL server and the user you
wish to use for running the application.

Once installed the site should run by navigating to the relevant location on your server from a web browser.
The default administrator login details are...

User: Admin
Password: neverknown
