				The source code may be used in other products regardless of their licence so 
				long as attribution is provided and accessible to users of the product. Attribution  
				within the product should be in the following form
				</p>
				<blockquote>				
				This product uses code licenced under the XCalibre8 Licence X licence as it stood on &lt;Licence Date&gt;.<br />

				<p>
				If source code units are used in their entirety the original licence comment must be 
				retained in the source file and will act as sufficient source attribution.
				</p>
				<p> 
				Code may be stripped from their original units and integrated directly or adapted 
				for use in other development languages so long as attribution to the original is provided 
				in the new or importing source following the same form as product attribution. The attribution 
				may be changed to state that the product adapts or has routines based on code licenced 
				under the XCalibre8 Licence X licence if it does not import full units or unaltered methods. 
				Attribution to multiple authors and/or products used under the XCalibre8 Licence X licence 
				should be grouped together to prevet repetition and it must be clear which units come from 
				which product and which products come from which authors.
